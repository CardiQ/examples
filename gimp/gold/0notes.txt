self inference:

not sure with known source:
for GIMP the annotations mainly rely on source-websites

in small task:
"gimp": [
    "7a4deb26-d57d-4ea9-9a73-630f66a7b568",
    "554785e9-4523-4e7a-b8e1-8016f565f56a"
  ],



other notes:
1. all tasks are by default assumed to be conducted with an opened Chrome unless specified
2. all batched actions are decided by the context (e.g. UI) before the action executed
